# Themes

Version 4.0 has been released!
Basically everything is custom now, except for some cases where the original would look best (e.g. the Discord Nitro banner).

There are currently 3 themes:

1. Glacial Prison - Blue/Cold themed
2. Infernal Prison - Red/Hot themed
3. Sakura Prison - Light Coral/Calm themed

Of course, these are just presets. 
You can give any theme your own creative twist by changing the provided variables!

If your theme look out of the ordinary, it is likely that Discord overhauled its default look.
I'll try to fix the problem at hand as soon as possible, so sit tight :)

Thanks for using my theme(s)!
If you have any questions, please shoot me a friend request at @RaijÅ«#7334.
